Revenues from faecal sludge (FS) treatment end products could offset treatment costs and contribute to financially viable sanitation. In urban sub-Saharan Africa, energy-producing resource recovery has the potential to generate greater revenue than use as soil conditioner. In contrast to wastewater sludge, the technical feasibility of using dried FS as solid fuel in industries has not been investigated. This study evaluated it through characterization of dried FS from drying beds and by assessing the combustion performance in two pilot-scale kilns; in Kampala and Dakar. Results from the fuel characterization demonstrate that dried FS had comparable fuel characteristics as wastewater sludge considering calorific value and ash content. The calorific values and ash contents were 10.9\textendash{}13.4 MJ/kg dry matter (DM) and 47.0\textendash{}58.7\%, respectively. Results from pilot-scale experiments suggest that dried FS can be effective in providing energy for industries. Temperatures in pilot-scale kilns fueled by FS were 800 $^\circ$C, sufficient for curing of clay bricks, and 437 $^\circ$C, sufficient for waste oil regeneration. In Kampala and Dakar, an estimated 20,000 tons of FS DM per year accumulate. Tapping the industrial fuel market and financial benefits could be realized through optimization of onsite sanitation and treatment technologies.},

  abstract = {The safe disposal of human excreta is of paramount importance for the health and welfare of populations living in low income countries as well as the prevention of pollution to the surrounding environment. On-site sanitation (OSS) systems are the most numerous means of treating excreta in low income countries, these facilities aim at treating human waste at source and can provide a hygienic and affordable method of waste disposal. However, current OSS systems need improvement and require further research and development. Development of OSS facilities that treat excreta at, or close to, its source require knowledge of the waste stream entering the system. Data regarding the generation rate and the chemical and physical composition of fresh feces and urine was collected from the medical literature as well as the treatability sector. The data were summarized and statistical analysis was used to quantify the major factors that were a significant cause of variability. The impact of this data on biological processes, thermal processes, physical separators, and chemical processes was then assessed. Results showed that the median fecal wet mass production was 128 g/cap/day, with a median dry mass of 29 g/cap/day. Fecal output in healthy individuals was 1.20 defecations per 24 hr period and the main factor affecting fecal mass was the fiber intake of the population. Fecal wet mass values were increased by a factor of 2 in low income countries (high fiber intakes) in comparison to values found in high income countries (low fiber intakes). Feces had a median pH of 6.64 and were composed of 74.6\% water. Bacterial biomass is the major component (25\textendash{}54\% of dry solids) of the organic fraction of the feces. Undigested carbohydrate, fiber, protein, and fat comprise the remainder and the amounts depend on diet and diarrhea prevalence in the population. The inorganic component of the feces is primarily undigested dietary elements that also depend on dietary supply. Median urine generation rates were 1.42 L/cap/day with a dry solids content of 59 g/cap/day. Variation in the volume and composition of urine is caused by differences in physical exertion, environmental conditions, as well as water, salt, and high protein intakes. Urine has a pH 6.2 and contains the largest fractions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium released from the body. The urinary excretion of nitrogen was significant (10.98 g/cap/day) with urea the most predominant constituent making up over 50\% of total organic solids. The dietary intake of food and fluid is the major cause of variation in both the fecal and urine composition and these variables should always be considered if the generation rate, physical, and chemical composition of feces and urine is to be accurately predicted.},

  abstract = {Sewage sludge, the inevitable by-product of municipal wastewater treatment plant operation, is a key issue in many countries due to its increasing volume and the impacts associated with its disposal. Thermochemical processing offers a new way of managing sewage sludge, not only by providing effective volume reduction, but also enabling transformation of carbon-rich organic fraction into valuable energy and fuel. Owing to some unique properties, sewage sludge differs from other solid fuels such as lignocellulosic biomass and coal, making its thermochemical conversion application somewhat complicated and challenging. This paper reviews the options of converting sewage sludge to energy and fuel via three main thermochemical conversion processes namely pyrolysis, gasification and combustion. The fundamental aspects of sewage sludge and its behaviour in each of thermochemical process are summarised. The challenges in adopting thermochemical conversion technology in sewage sludge management are addressed, and various alternative approaches deserving further consideration, such as the incorporation of pre-processing and co-utilisation, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Waste residues produced by agricultural and forestry industries can generate energy and are regarded as a promising source of sustainable fuels. Pyrolysis, where waste biomass is heated under low-oxygen conditions, has recently attracted attention as a means to add value to these residues. The material is carbonized and yields a solid product known as biochar. In this study, eight types of biomass were evaluated for their suitability as raw material to produce biochar. Material was pyrolyzed at either 350 $^\circ$C or 500 $^\circ$C and changes in ash content, volatile solids, fixed carbon, higher heating value (HHV) and yield were assessed. For pyrolysis at 350 $^\circ$C, significant correlations (p \&lt; 0.01) between the biochars' ash and fixed carbon content and their HHVs were observed. Masson pine wood and Chinese fir wood biochars pyrolyzed at 350 $^\circ$C and the bamboo sawdust biochar pyrolyzed at 500 $^\circ$C were suitable for direct use in fuel applications, as reflected by their higher HHVs, higher energy density, greater fixed carbon and lower ash contents. Rice straw was a poor substrate as the resultant biochar contained less than 60\% fixed carbon and a relatively low HHV. Of the suitable residues, carbonization via pyrolysis is a promising technology to add value to pecan shells and Miscanthus.},

  abstract = {Increased crop yield is a commonly reported benefit of adding biochar to soils. However, experimental results are variable and dependent on the experimental set-up, soil properties and conditions, while causative mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. A statistical meta-analysis was undertaken with the aim of evaluating the relationship between biochar and crop productivity (either yield or above-ground biomass). Results showed an overall small, but statistically significant, benefit of biochar application to soils on crop productivity, with a grand mean increase of 10\%. However, the mean results for each analysis performed within the meta-analysis covered a wide range (from -28\% to 39\%). The greatest (positive) effects with regard to soil analyses were seen in acidic (14\%) and neutral pH soils (13\%), and in soils with a coarse (10\%) or medium texture (13\%). This suggests that two of the main mechanisms for yield increase may be a liming effect and an improved water holding capacity of the soil, along with improved crop nutrient availability. The greatest positive result was seen in biochar applications at a rate of 100tha-1 (39\%). Of the biochar feedstocks considered and in relation to crop productivity, poultry litter showed the strongest (significant) positive effect (28\%), in contrast to biosolids, which were the only feedstock showing a statistically significant negative effect (-28\%). However, many auxiliary data sets (i.e. information concerning co-variables) are incomplete and the full range of relevant soil types, as well as environmental and management conditions are yet to be investigated. Furthermore, only short-term studies limited to periods of 1 to 2 years are currently available. This paper highlights the need for a strategic research effort, to allow elucidation of mechanisms, differentiated by environmental and management factors and to include studies over longer time frames.},

  abstract = {The poor management of human excreta in developing countries is among the most prominent global issues due to its negative impact on public health. This work demonstrates for the first time that self-sustaining smouldering of faeces mixed with sand is a feasible alternative to incineration for rapid destruction of waste. Self-sustaining smouldering requires minimal energy input and pre-drying of faeces compared to incineration. This process ensures the elimination of biological hazards via long residence times ($>$20min) at high temperatures ($>$400$^\circ$C). Surrogate faeces which exhibits similar energetic, thermal, and mechanical properties to real faeces are used in this study. The parameters controlling the combustion process including moisture content, airflow rate, and sand-to-faeces ratio are mapped to establish the range of conditions where self-sustaining smouldering of faeces can be achieved. Experiments were conducted within the ranges 0\textendash{}75\% for moisture content, 7\textendash{}108g/min for airflow rate and 2.75\textendash{}11.9g/g for sand-to-faeces (wet basis) ratio. Preliminary validation of the parameter space is done using real dog faeces. In this work, the parameter space defining the range of conditions where self-sustaining smouldering occurs is mapped. Results show successful self-sustaining smouldering of faeces for moisture contents of up to 60\%, airflow ranging from 10 to 100g/min, and wet sand-to-faeces ratio greater than 3.25. This proof-of-concept for a smouldering reactor to treat human solid waste demonstrates that smouldering of faeces could be the basis for a new, energy efficient waste treatment approach.},

These new sanitary systems are expected to safely treat faecal waste and operate without external connections to a sewer, water supply or energy source. The Nano Membrane Toilet (NMT) is a unique domestic-scale sanitary solution currently being developed to treat human waste on-site. This toilet will employ a small-scale gasifier to convert human faeces into products of high energy value. This study investigated the suitability of human faeces as a feedstock for gasification. It quantified the recoverable exergy potential from human faeces and explored the optimal routes for thermal conversion, using a thermodynamic equilibrium model. Fresh human faeces were found to have approximately 70\textendash{}82wt.\% moisture and 3\textendash{}6wt.\% ash. Product gas resulting from a typical dry human faeces (0wt.\% moisture) had LHV and exergy values of 17.2MJ/kg and 24MJ/kg respectively at optimum equivalence ratio of 0.31, values that are comparable to wood biomass. For suitable conversion of moist faecal samples, near combustion operating conditions are required, if an external energy source is not supplied. This is however at 5\% loss in the exergy value of the gas, provided both thermal heat and energy of the gas are recovered. This study shows that the maximum recoverable exergy potential from an average adult moist human faeces can be up to 15MJ/kg, when the gasifier is operated at optimum equivalence ratio of 0.57, excluding heat losses, distribution or other losses that result from operational activities.},
